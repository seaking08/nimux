## Set up

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/it-at-m/nimux.git
2. Create a new Firebase project.
3. Enable the Authentication module with email and password.
4. Enable Firestore and create a new database with default settings.
5. Start a new collection named "UtilCollection" with document "AllowCreateAccount" which contains field "allow" with boolean value true or false.
6. Add a new collection "tenants" and add a document; e.g. "tenant_demo"
7. Add a new collection "userTenants". Use it to map users to tenants and role. Therefore add a new document with the user id copied from Firebase Authentication. Inside the document create the field "role" with the value "admin" or "access" and the field "tenantId" with the name of the tenant; e.g. "tenant_demo"
8. Add a new collection "helpCollection". If you want you can provide Knowledgebase-articles inside the app. Therefore add a new document with the fields "body" (string), "orderPos" (number) and "title" (string).
9. Inside the firebase console switch to firestore and select the tab "Rules". Copy the provided rules from the file firestore.rules.
10. Download your google-services.json file from the Firebase console and put it inside the /app directory.


## Build the app
1. If you like, change the App ID in `build.gradle.kts` to your own.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE, sync Gradle, and build.




## Documentation

To use the app on your own you have to set up a firebase project.

**Supported Features**

- Easily add, categorize, and manage items
- Real-time overview of stock levels and check-outs
- Centralized organization of all resources
- Smart extras: analytics

**Adding new organizational unit**
If you want to add another department in your own firebase instance create a new tenant and map the corresponding user to the tenant and id as described above. Inside the tenant document create a new collection called "ManagePWCollection" and inside this collection a new document "ManagePWDoc". The "ManagePWDoc" should contain a field "pw" as type string. This field is the master password to access admin functionality inside the app from an account with the role "access".
